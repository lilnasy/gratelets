# astro-client-interaction

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#83](https://github.com/lilnasy/gratelets/pull/83) [`e19eab0`](https://github.com/lilnasy/gratelets/commit/e19eab0feba92c492cdc89d2a4b15f284d683142) Thanks [@leomp12](https://github.com/leomp12)! - Introduces the "idle" value to the `client:interaction` directive. When set, an interaction will schedule the loading of the component for when the browser is idle, instead of loading it immediately.

  ```astro
  ---
  import Component from "../components/Counter.jsx"
  ---
  <Component client:interaction="idle" />
  ```

  By default, a component with the `client:interaction` directive could be loaded before or after the ones with the `client:idle` directive, depending on the timing of the first interaction. This feature allows `client:interaction` components to predictably lower loading priority than `client:idle` components.
