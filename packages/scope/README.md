## Why astro-scope?
ðŸ¤·

## Installation

### Manual Install

First, install the `astro-scope` package using your package manager. If you're using npm or aren't sure, run this in the terminal:

```sh
npm install astro-scope
```

Then, apply this integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

```diff lang="js" "scope()"
  // astro.config.mjs
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
+ import scope from 'astro-scope';

  export default defineConfig({
    // ...
    integrations: [scope()],
    //             ^^^^^^^
  });
```

## Usage

Once the Astro scope integration is installed and added to the configuration file, you can import the scope from the `"astro:scope"` namespace.

```astro
---
import scope from "astro:scope"
---
<h1>{scope}</h1>
```

You can also import the scope into a client-side script. The scope will be the same in the frontmatter and in the script.

```html
<script>
    import scope from "astro:scope"
    console.log(scope)
</script>
<h1>{scope}</h1>
```

Note that the Astro scope can only be imported inside a `.astro` file. Importing it into an API route, middleware or framework component will throw an error. If you need the scope of a particular astro component to be available to other components, you can pass it as a prop.

```astro
---
import scope from "astro:scope"
import Component from "./OtherComponent.jsx"
---
<Component {scope} />
```
